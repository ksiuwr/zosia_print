# Zosia-print

Zosia-print is a project that aims to automate creation of all printables that are needed at the ZOSIA conference. Based on HTML templates PDF files are generated using [Weasyprint](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint).

This repository also [contains information](/data/) regarding lectures schedules over years and places description.

## Overview of solution

- We generate HTML templates for Weasyprint using following data:
  * places - yaml file that contains descriptions of attractions that are available nearby, needs to be updated manually to fit the location. Those files are kept in this repository.
  * schedule - csv file that contains schedule of the conference generated in the scheduler-spreadsheet.
  * data.json - json file to be exported from the Zosia website.

- Templates and PDFs generation, as well as data validation is done by `zosia_print.py` script.
- Generated files will be placed in the `gen` directory.
